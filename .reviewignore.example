# .reviewignore - Patterns for files to exclude from code review
# This file works similar to .gitignore with glob pattern matching

# Dependency lock files (already in global blacklist, but shown as example)
# go.sum
# go.mod
# package-lock.json

# Configuration files you might want to skip
# *.yaml
# *.yml
# *.json

# Test fixtures or mock data
# test/fixtures/*
# **/mocks/*
# **/__snapshots__/*

# Generated code or build artifacts
# **/*.generated.ts
# **/*.pb.go
# dist/*
# build/*

# Documentation that doesn't need review
# docs/*
# *.md

# Specific files you want to exclude
# legacy/old-code.py
# vendor/*

# Pattern examples:
# - Exact filename: config.json
# - Wildcard: *.min.js
# - Directory: node_modules/*
# - Nested: **/test/**/*.txt
# - Multiple extensions: *.{jpg,png,gif}
